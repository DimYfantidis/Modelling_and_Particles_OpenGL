# Modelling and Particles in OpenGL

This cooperative project involves the implementation of advanced topics Computer Graphics such as 
hierarchical 3D modelling and particle/physics systems using C and FreeGLUT for rendering and interaction.

### Hierarchical Modelling

* Rendering of a hierarchical (tree) 3D model of a dog, comprised of `GLUquadricObj`s. 
* Features a GUI (drop-menu) for interacting with the rendered model, which can perform different actions such as "jump", "give paw", "nod", etc. 
* Virtual dog is initially located on the origin,
  $$
      (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)
  $$
* The camera performs a low-res motion along the surface of a sphere centered at the origin, always oriented to face the origin directly.
  $$
    x_c^2 + y_c^2 + z_c^2 = r^2
  $$
* Camera position $(x_c, y_c, z_c)$ is modified using the arrow keys. 
* Sphere radius is increased/decreased using the PgUp/PgDn buttons.

### Particle Physics

* Simulation of a 3D particle system using classical (newtonian) dynamics and collisions. 
* Features a GUI (drop-menu) for interacting with the world, which can render different surfaces. 
* Air drag is turned on or off by pressing the 'A' key (toggle mode) and increased/decreased using the Up/Down arrow keys.
* Virtual dog is initially located on the origin,
  $$
      (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)
  $$
* The camera performs a high-res motion along the surface of a sphere centered at the origin, always oriented to face the origin directly.
  $$
    x_c^2 + y_c^2 + z_c^2 = r^2
  $$
* Camera position $(x_c, y_c, z_c)$ is modified by moving the mouse while holding down left mouse button. 
* Sphere radius is increased/decreased by scrolling the wheel Up/Down.

### Setup (Windows)

*Project is platform-specific for MS Windows architectures as it uses the `<Windows.h>` API and precombiled binaries of FreeGLUT for Windows.*

1. Clone the project:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DimYfantidis/Modelling_and_Particles_OpenGL.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `build` directory:
    ```
    cd ./build
    ```
3. Compile using CMake for ðŸŸ£ Visual Studio (MSVC):
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```
4. Open the main solution, `./build/modelling_and_particles.sln`, using Visual Studio.
5. Set the `modelling_and_particles` project as startup project.
6. Run the program (Ctrl + F5).
